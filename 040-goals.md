# Goals

Our team was tasked with handling vaccination attestation for contractors and visitors who would be working in federal buildings or on federal lands. Initially, we had two goals for this work.

First, **we wanted the workforce to be safe**[^safe]. This goal was supported unconditionally by conversations with agency leaders, all of whom were concerned with operating their agencies and facilities in a way that kept people safe. In some cases, this meant remaining in a “maximum telework” posture, and for others, it meant establishing protocols and practices in the workplace to protect people who needed to be physically present in the workplace.

Second, **we wanted to engender trust**. To **attest** to something means to *assert it is true without evidence*. This meant that the process of attestation was fundamentally about trust. Thus, any educational materials, agency processes, or software systems we developed would need to enhance trust in the attestation process. This goal was reinforced through conversations with agency leadership.

Midway through our work, two new Executive Orders ([14042](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19924/ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors) and [14043](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19927/requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees)) were issued requiring vaccination for the Federal and contracting workforce. Our efforts shifted from *attestation* of vaccination status to *evidence* of vaccination. Our primary goals&mdash;to keep the workforce safe and to engender trust&mdash;did not change, but now we had a third goal: **protecting the personal health information of the workforce**.

If we were called upon to continue our work, these three goals would continue to be "north star" goals of our efforts:

1. To keep the federal workforce (writ large) safe.
1. To engender trust in government and its processes.
1. To develop socio-technical systems that protect and guarantee the privacy of the people whose data we are entrusted with.
