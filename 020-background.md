# Background

Our engagement was 36 work days. It began on August 16th, 2021 and ended on Monday, September 20th.

Our initial charge focused on workplace safety. During the first 18 days, we focused on vaccine attestation for contractors and visitors to federal buildings and lands. This involved conducting interview- and desk-research regarding agencies, their operations, and the socio-technical solutions that might play a role in supporting government-wide attestation and COVID-19 testing programs.

* We interviewed agency leaders, CIOs, building managers, and federal employees who regularly visited federal facilities.
* We spoke with industry leaders on digital health records, including potential partners who contributed to the development of national standards in this space.
* We mapped policy documents to understand and operationalize those policies, with particular concern for edge cases and unforeseen consequences.
* We prototyped systems for capturing vaccination records and test results in human- and machine-readable forms.

On September 9th, two Executive Orders were issued: [14042](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19924/ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors) and [14043](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19927/requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees). These Executive Orders established the requirement for all federal employees and contractors to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Our project shifted focus from a question of how to capture a contractorâ€™s *attestation* of vaccination status to one of how to capture *evidence* of vaccination status for federal employees. This focus shift was due to the immediate and impending deadline communicated in the Executive Orders. During the final 6 days of the project, we developed user-flows, began architectural design informed by compliance processes, and began to set up the automation and code that would serve as a foundation for this project. We were prepared, from prior work, to launch code and ATO on an extremely rapid basis.

Monday, September 20th, the project ended.
