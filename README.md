# Vaccine Attestation

Our work was focused on the safe return of the federal workforce to buildings. Our particular charge regarded trying to address how to record and share contractorsâ€™ attestation of vaccination status. Our focus on attestation (a statement whose truth is asserted without evidence) changed three weeks into our effort, as Executive Orders 14042 and 14043 together established requirements for the federal workforce (including contractors) to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. In response, we pivoted to demonstrate systems to capture evidence of vaccination status, as opposed to an attestation.

Our research with agency leaders and industry experts yielded a broad understanding of safety, privacy, and implementation concerns that would impact our work. UX and design considerations focus on user flows as well as communications and messaging in vaccine attestation and evidence-tracking systems. Policy considerations suggest ways that education and safety can, in the future, be kept at the fore. Our technology leverages open standards for representing and sharing personal health information; Smart Health Cards provide an open framework for both decentralizing and protecting the privacy of personal health information.
