# Executive Summary

Our work was focused on the safe return of the federal workforce to buildings. Our particular charge regarded trying to address how to record and share contractors’ attestation of vaccination status. Our focus on attestation (a statement whose truth is asserted *without* evidence) changed three weeks into our effort, as Executive Orders 14042[^14042] and 14043[^14043] together established requirements for the federal workforce (including contractors) to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ([Section 2: Background](020-background.md)). In response, we pivoted to demonstrate systems to capture *evidence* of vaccination status, as opposed to an *attestation*.

We approached this work from a principled standpoint ([Section 3: Principles](030-principles.md)). Any solution we developed needed to be equitable and accessible, given a potential user base of 10M+ users. Because it would handle personal health information, we believed it should preserve privacy and leave control of such information in the hands of individuals. Our solution needed to be transparent and clear in operation, lest it incur distrust; our work takes place against a social and political backdrop of misinformation and distrust of public systems ([Section 4: Goals](040-goals.md)). 

Our research with agency leaders and industry experts yielded a broad understanding of safety, privacy, and implementation concerns that would impact our work ([Section 5: Design Considerations](050-design-considerations.md)). UX and design considerations focus on user flows as well as communications and messaging in vaccine attestation and evidence-tracking systems. Policy considerations suggest ways that education and safety can, in the future, be kept at the fore. Our technology leverages open standards for representing and sharing personal health information; Smart Health Cards provide an open framework for both decentralizing and protecting the privacy of personal health information.

What follows is a brief summary of the project background, principles, goals, and design (one page each). For future teams charged with continuing this work, we include a set of design considerations ranging from user experience to policy to technical implementation. We’ve also included policy and communication considerations to support safe facilities and workspaces. These considerations are an expression of our team’s principles and goals *at a particular moment in history*, and may not apply to future efforts if the context has changed sufficiently.
