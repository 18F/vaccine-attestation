# Principles

As our research progressed, we established principles to serve as the foundation for our work. These principles emerged from our discovery, and guided the solution space described in [Section 5: Design Considerations](050-design-considerations.md).

1. **Equity and Accessibility**. Any solution to vaccine attestation (and, later, evidence of vaccination) would need to be equitable and accessible. Assumptions about systems that might work for Federal employees might fail to be equitable when proposed for contractors or workers covered under an OSHA order. Similarly, any solution that is not accessible to everyone is exclusionary, and we were unwilling to envision such systems.
2. **Privacy**. Vaccination information is Protected Health Information (PHI). All of the information is sensitive. So we ask: Are we asking for only necessary (minimal) information? Has the user provided consent? How do they retain control of their information? How is access limited to only those that need to know? Securely ensuring people’s privacy, and allowing them to control how and where their information is used, helps to establish and safeguard the public’s trust in the system.
3. **Transparency and Clarity**. The COVID-19 pandemic, on top of immense tragedy, has sowed uncertainty and distrust in our society. Health guidance during the pandemic has shifted often. Transparency of purpose and clarity of process is vital in ensuring integrity in the information provided. Have we effectively communicated why, what and how?
4. **Open Standards**. Finally, we believe that open tools and open standards are the necessary and interoperable foundation for any digital project that will serve the government and the public. This principle is *emergent*: only by using standards unencumbered by licenses or copyright can we achieve our other principles of equity, accessibility, privacy, and transparency.

These principles emerged from our reading, conversations with leaders across government, and our own lived experiences designing and developing systems that serve the public. Given evolving policy and the pandemic itself, these principles serve as the foundation upon which any work is built. TTS should evaluate continuation of the work if it can not uphold these principles.

We recommend Siddarth et al.’s *Vaccine Credential Technology Principles* for its considered exploration of these principles[^vctp]. We found this work late in our process, and found it to align extremely well with and speak to our own sincerely held beliefs.
