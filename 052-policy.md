# Policy considerations

The guidelines from the Safer Federal Workforce spoke to much more than  facility safety. Our work was more focused on facility safety. Specifically, we were interested in how policy and technology together create both the perception and reality of workplace safety.

Based on our goal of safety within federal facilities, we considered the simplest possible policies and technologies that would communicate and create a safe workplace. Universally requiring masking within federal facilities would achieve this goal. This is an easily enforced policy that requires simple technology (masks) and promotes trust and upholds safety in the workplace. We also suggest building more educational tools and resources to help agency teams, facilities personnel, and federal employees. These materials would help people understand the Safer Federal Workplace Task Force guidance, make good decisions, and ensure policies are consistent with behavioral expectations. Inherent in these educational materials should be a model focused on *collective responsibility*.

## Establish universal masking requirements in federal facilities
We believe that universal masking is the simplest and most reliable way to protect safety and reduce community spread of COVID-19 within federal facilities.

A policy that requires two different behaviors of individuals based on vaccination status makes it extremely difficult to enforce either. By trying to balance the perceived comfort of not wearing masks against the safety of those who have to enter federal facilities, the current guidance creates a masking policy that is essentially difficult to enforce consistently and equitably.

Different policies for vaccinated and unvaccinated people creates a “lower-friction” path for people to misrepresent their vaccination status rather than mask or go through a rigorous testing process. Mask wearing is a complex personal and social choice[^toxic]<sup>,</sup>[^maskoff]; people who are hesitant or otherwise refuse to wear masks may also be those who are most likely to lie about their vaccination status; consistent, universal policies help shift discourse and practice in a way that optional policies do not.

## Simplify guidance and build tools to help facilities personnel ensure policies are consistent with expectations

Agency COVID-19 safety teams and facilities managers need support to make good decisions based on the needs of their workforce, localities, and the communities they serve. In our conversations with other agencies, many noted that they felt they did not have the public health expertise to confidently make the right choices, even with the Task Force guidelines.

The task force guidance tells safety teams and facility managers that they should consider local conditions when determining their safety protocols. However, that is much harder to do in practice. Even with the COVID-19 data tracker from the CDC, it can be hard for local managers to interpret community spread data, particularly in locations where the data is unreliable.

Any  future effort to build a vaccination attestation or evidence-collection system will need content and messaging expertise to regularly provide support and updates for safety teams and facility managers, including real-time guidance on safety protocols, educational materials for managers, printable materials for building signage, and safety and de-escalation training for security staff and other employees.

## Focus on education and empowerment, not just compliance

Don’t just tell people what to do, also communicate *why*. When we only tell people what to do, our guidance will only make sense in the contexts that we are able to anticipate, but that will inevitably miss the full diversity of facilities and situations employees encounter.

With ever-changing guidance and widespread misinformation in the broader ecosystem, it is hard for people to know what to do, and know what sources to trust when the context is unclear. By telling people why and when guidance changed, as well as providing information on how to assess their own situation, empower people to make their own decisions. By acknowledging uncertainty but showing how decisions are made, we build more trust and confidence that they are safe and can help enforce safety procedures when in federal facilities.
