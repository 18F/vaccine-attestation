# Design Considerations

Our design considerations are written for a future implementation team. This is not an implementation specification; it is a watercolor depiction of how our [principles](/030-principles.md) and [goals](/040-goals.md) manifested as user experience and technical design. The entire window for this work spanned 36 days, and we were rapidly moving through research, design, architecture, and ATO considerations with the intention of starting small and iterating. A future team may find our thinking useful, or the context may be too different to be of value.

We outline our [user](FIXME), [policy](FIXME), and [technical](FIXME) considerations. The end goal is to promote safety and equitable access to government facilities and services. Our user research showed us the diversity of the workforce, the challenges in rapid workplace and policy changes, how employees perceive buildings as not only places to work but also as community spaces, and how psychological safety is a crucial component of trust. Aided by conversations with partners and agencies, we discuss some preliminary user flows, notification loops, and how to enable clear communication of goals for behavioral change.

In terms of policy, our guidance is to establish a universal mask mandate as the only enforceable and viable policy that promotes and upholds safety in the workplace. We also suggest building educational tools to help facilities personnel make good decisions which will help clarify guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force and ensure policies are consistent with behavioral expectations. Inherent these policy recommendations is a model of collective responsibility.

Regarding technology, we chose Smart Health Cards as a standard for representation and verification of vaccine related information. We review our prototyping for vaccine attestation, outline several information architecture concerns (in particular, we discuss the sensitivity of recording personal health information), consider how best to implement PPRLs (privacy-preserving record linkages), possible ATO (authorization to operate) roadblocks and how to overcome these, and conclude with a list of resources of organizations and open standards that were useful in our technical work.
